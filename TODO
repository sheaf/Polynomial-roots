TODO:


General:

Unify different rendering schemes: use of Int or other coefficients,
    and use of different colouring schemes, without recompiling.



Computation:

Optimise (better bounds, etc).



Trees:

Rewrite to allow more general schemes (with different pruning methods).



IFS:

Make use of Trees rewrite to incorporate other IFS-like methods.
Complete unification of different IFS methods, minimising code overlap.



Parsing:

Error if no config file found.
Explain config file specification.
Make sure parsing works properly (as of now, can fail with no error message,
    e.g. output-size being given a single argument).
Proper parsing of all input (e.g. negative numbers...).
Allow different coefficient sets (and different types, i.e. Int/Double/...).
Allow parsing of gradients (with different methods).
Parse different IFS modes (i.e. straight up sets of functions).

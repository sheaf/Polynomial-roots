TODO:

Computation:
Optimise (better bounds, etc).
Add parallelisation.

Parsing:
Change pCd2 etc to allow both tuples and complex numbers.
Add option to read in named colours as opposed to just hex values.
Make parsing more consistent and make sure it always works.
Cleanup gradient parsing.
Give helpful error messages for parsing pairs, lists, etc.

Colouring:
Fix source colouring coefficient matching method.
Allow additional gradient with source colouring (instead of just hsv).

Comments:
Add comments everywhere, with documentation.

Roots:
Add scale factor utility in some form.

Plotting:
Make sure giving different centres (etc) for runspec/mode gives reasonable results.

General:
Command line parameter to determine output file.
Flip y-axis in image routines.
Cleanup using roots/ifs, source/density, different coeffs... uniformly!

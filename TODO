TODO:

Computation:
Optimise (better bounds, etc).
Add parallelisation for trees, roots, ifs, rendering.
Speed up companion matrix calculation (esp. spurious calculations of companion').

Parsing:
Change pCd2 etc to allow both tuples and complex numbers.
Add option to read in named colours as opposed to just hex values.
Make parsing more consistent and make sure it always works.

Colouring:
Allow output of transparent png files.

Comments:
Add comments everywhere, with documentation.

Roots:
Add scale factor utility in some form.

General:
Command line parameter to determine output file.
Flip y-axis in image routines.
Cleanup using roots/ifs, source/density, different coeffs... uniformly!

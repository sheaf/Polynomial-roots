TODO:

Computation:
Optimise (better bounds, etc).
Add parallelisation for trees, roots, ifs, rendering.
Speed up companion matrix calculation (esp. spurious calculations of companion').
Improve routines in Polynomials module, especially memory consumption.

Colouring:
Allow output of transparent png files.

Gradients:
Clean up gradient specifications, and allow parsing of transforms.
Add more named gradients.

Comments:
Add comments everywhere, with documentation.

Roots:
Add scale factor utility in some form.

General:
Command line parameter to determine output file.
Flip y-axis in image routines.
Cleanup using roots/ifs, source/density, different coeffs... uniformly!

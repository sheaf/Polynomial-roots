TODO:

Computation:
Optimise (better bounds, etc).
Add parallelisation.

Parsing:
Change pCd2 etc to allow both tuples and complex numbers.
Add option to read in named colours as opposed to just hex values.
Make parsing more consistent and make sure it always works.

Comments:
Add comments everywhere, with documentation.

Roots:
Add scale factor utility in some form.

General:
Flip y-axis in image routines.
Cleanup using roots/ifs, source/density, different coeffs... uniformly!

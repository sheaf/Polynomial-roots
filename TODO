TODO:


Computation:

Allow complex coefficients (not supported by polySolve).
Optimise (better bounds, etc).


Parsing:

Error if no config file found.
Explain config file specification.
Make sure parsing works properly (as of now, can fail with no error message,
    e.g. output-size being given a single argument).
Proper parsing of all input (e.g. negative numbers...).
Allow different coefficient sets (and different types, i.e. Int/Double/...).
Allow parsing of gradients (with different methods).


Gradients:

Allow height parameters.
Incorporate alternative colouring for both roots/ifs.


Plotting:

Fix cheating IFS using possible bounds; + unify noncheating/cheating versions.
Fix scale factors: scaling depending on the point instead of global factors.

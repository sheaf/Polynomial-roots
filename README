This program generates images related to roots of polynomials.

There are two main routines:

- Roots.
This plots roots of polynomials. Given a particular viewing region R in the complex plane,
a set of coefficients A and a degree d, this plots all roots of polynomials of degree up to d,
with coefficients in A, within the region R.

- IFS.
This plots the corresponding iterated function systems, and tries to scale them
to make them look like the corresponding plot of roots.


The program parses options from the configuration file "roots.config".
A sample configuration file is available.

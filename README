This program generates images related to roots of polynomials.

There are two main routines:

- Roots.
This plots roots of polynomials. Given a particular viewing region R in the complex plane,
a set of coefficients A and a degree d, this plots all roots of polynomials of degree up to d,
with coefficients in A, within the region R.

- IFS.
This plots the corresponding iterated function systems, and tries to predict the scale factors
to make it look like the corresponding plot of roots.


The program can parse options at runtime, otherwise it takes in a config file,
such as the following (no blank line at the beginning):

run-mode: gui
render: roots 28{
center: 0.1275 0.7000  
size: 0.001 0.001
output-size: 400 400
fix-aspect: None
gradient: warm}
